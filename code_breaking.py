# Code 1

# You recovered an Enigma machine! Amazingly, it is set up in that day's position, ready for you to replicate in your software. But unfortunately the label has worn off the reflector. All the other settings are still in place, however. You also found a book with the title "SECRETS" which contained the following code, could it be so simple that the code contains that text?

#     Code: DMEXBMKYCVPNQBEDHXVPZGKMTFFBJRPJTLHLCHOTKOYXGGHZ
