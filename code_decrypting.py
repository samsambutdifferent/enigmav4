    # I later remembered that I had given the tutor permission to use the Enigma machine to solve some codes I'd received via
    # email. As for the window, they are just a big fan of parkour, this is always how they leave the building. It seems they
    # are stuck on one last code. It came in via email so we suspect it's just spam, probably related to a social media website,
    # but you never know when you'll find a gem in that kind of stuff.
    # The tutor has narrowed the search and found most of the settings, but it seems this code was made with a non-standard
    # reflector. Indeed, there was a photo attached to the email along with the code. It appears that the sender has taken a
    # standard reflector, cracked it open, and swapped some of the wires – two pairs of wires have been modified, by the looks
    # of the dodgy soldering job.
    # To be clear, a single wire connects two letters, e.g. mapping A to Y and Y to A. The sender has taken two wires
    # (fours pairs of letters), e.g. A-Y and H-J, and swapped one of the ends, so one option would be H-Y and A-J. 
    # They did this twice, so they modified eight letters total (they did not swap the same wire more than once).
    # In your answer, include what the original reflector was and the modifications.
